#Getting and Cleaning Data
##Course Project

###File Dependencies
-run_analysis.R
-features.txt
-activity_labels.txt
-train/subject_train.txt
-train/y_train.txt
train/x_train.txt
-test/subject_test.txt
-test/y_test.txt
-test/x_test.txt

###Library Dependencies
-library(dplyr)

I tried to use all the files given to us.  So you will need features.txt and activity_labels.txt.

If you have these in your working directory along with the data folders train and test then everything should run.

Because this course talked about dplyr library I thought I would try to use it for the first time.
